# Mobi-bike-share-data-analysis
Using data on usage of Mobi Bike-share in 2018,  the pattern of bike usage was analyzed under different time periods and areas. The frequency of the usage was identified as a factor affecting Mobi’s revenue and the difference between the departing and returning bike at any station as a factor affecting Mobi’s cost, since the bike would have to be physically moved back to the station with high departure rate. Lastly, an additional data on weather was added to further refine the analysis to include the effect of temperature and rainfall on frequency of bike sharing.
